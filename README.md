## Dialing app

This simple web application implements integration with Twilio service.   

**[Demo](https://truedialer.lifous.com/)**

It uses trial Twilio account, so real calls are not possible. But you can enter your own credentials with "Custom call" button. 

Application components:

- **[Yii Framework](https://www.yiiframework.com/)** as a backend core
- **[Faker](https://github.com/fzaninotto/Faker)** for realtime data generating
- **[Sweet Alert 2](https://sweetalert2.github.io/)** for success/error messages
- **[Twilio SDK](https://www.twilio.com/)** for calls
